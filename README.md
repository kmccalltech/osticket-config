Name one dc-1 (Domain Controller) and set the image to Windows Server 2022.

Name second VM client-1 and set the image to Windows 10.

Using dc-1's public IP address, remote desktop into dc-1. Navigate to the start menu -> run -> search for wf.msc

This will open up the firewall settings for DC-1. Go to Windows Defender Firewall Properties and turn off the firewall for each tab. Be sure to click apply when finished.
After that go to Client-1's Network Settings -> Network Interface -> DNS settings. Enter in DC-1's private IP address (this can be found in DC-1's network settings or overview tab). Be sure to click save. Then once the settings are saved navigate back to the virtual machines homepage and give Client-1 a restart by checking its box and clicking "Restart"
When Client-1 has restarted, remote desktop into Client-1 using its public IP address.

<p>Within Client-1 open up PowerShell and ping DC-1 to ensure that both VMs are on the same virtual network and that DC-1's firewall is disabled.

Next, type "ipconfig /all and look to make sure the DNS server of Client-1 is set to DC-1's private IP address.</p>
